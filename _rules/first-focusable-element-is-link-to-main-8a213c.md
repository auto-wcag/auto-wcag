## Applicability

This rule applies to any [HTML web page][].

## Expectation 1

There is at least one [focusable][] element within the test target.

## Expectation 2

The first [focusable][] element within the test target:

- is [keyboard actionable][]; and
- has a [semantic role][] of `link`; and
- when [activated][], moves focus [at the start][] of the [main block of content][] of the [document][]; and
- has an [accessible name][] that communicates that it links to the [main block of content][].

## Assumptions

- This rule assumes that there is exactly one [main block of content][] inside each [HTML web page][].
- This rule assumes that the description of the link is provided through its [accessible name][].
- This rule assumes that [Technique G1: Adding a link at the top of each page that goes directly to the main content area][tech g1] requires that the link can be [activated][] by use of keyboard, including being part of [sequential focus navigation][] (in order to be useful for keyboard users).
- This rule assumes that any global dismissible information that only appears once per site has already been acknowledged and is not displayed anymore. Many sites display a cookies policy banner which might be stealing focus until dismissed (usually by viewing and accepting cookies policy). If such a banner is taken into account, the rule may fail incorrectly.

## Accessibility Support

_There are no major accessibility support issues known for this rule._

## Background

- [G1: Adding a link at the top of each page that goes directly to the main content area][tech g1]

Unless specified otherwise, the [main block of content][] of each document is defined by the `main` element.

## Test Cases

### Passed

#### Passed Example 1

In this document, the first [focusable][] element is [visible][], is [included in the accessibility tree][], is a link, and when [activated][] moves the focus to the [main block of content][]. Its [accessible name][] (coming from content) communicates that it skips to the main content.

```html
<html lang="en">
	<head>
		<title>The Three Kingdoms, Chapter 1</title>
	</head>
	<body>

			<p>The Romance of the Three Kingdoms is a 14th century historical novel.</p>
		</aside>

		<main id="main">
			<h1>Three Heroes Swear Brotherhood at a Feast in the Peach Garden</h1>
			<p>
				Unity succeeds division and division follows unity. One is bound to be replaced by the other after a long span
				of time.
			</p>
		</main>
	</body>
</html>
```

#### Passed Example 2

In this document, the link to skip to the [main block of content][] is [included in the accessibility tree][], and is [visible][] when [focused][].

		</main>
	</body>
</html>
```

#### Passed Example 3

In this document, the element to skip to the [main block of content][] is [visible][], has a [semantic role][] of `link` and can be [activated][] by using the keyboard.

</html>
```

#### Passed Example 4

```html
<html lang="en">
	<head>
		<title>The Three Kingdoms, Chapter 1</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		<nav>
			<a href="#main" aria-label="Skip to main content">📖</a>

				of time.
			</p>
		</main>
	</body>
</html>
```

#### Passed Example 5

```html
<html lang="en">
	<head>
		<title>The Three Kingdoms, Chapter 1</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		<aside id="about-book">

			<p>
				Unity succeeds division and division follows unity. One is bound to be replaced by the other after a long span
				of time.
			</p>
		</main>
	</body>
</html>
```

#### Passed Example 6

In this document, the first [focusable][] element is the link to the [main block of content][]. The link to W3C is located before in tree order but after in focus order due to the `tabindex` attributes.

```html
<html lang="en">
	<head>
		<title>The Three Kingdoms, Chapter 1</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		<nav>
			<a href="https://www.w3.org/" tabindex="2">Check out the W3C</a>
			<a href="#main" tabindex="1">Skip to main content</a>
		</nav>

		<aside id="about-book">

				of time.
			</p>
		</main>
	</body>
</html>
```

#### Passed Example 7

```html
<html lang="en">
	<head>
		<title>The Three Kingdoms, Chapter 1</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		<nav>
